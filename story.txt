Once upon a time, there was a man named Bob who lived in Madison, Wisconsin.
When he was younger, Bob went to The University of Wisconsin at Madison and his favorite class was CS 400. 

Bob had a friend, who was also in CS400. This friend, however, was not longer able to enjoy the thrills of CS400 because of the Coronavirus. .

Bobs friend was a freshman at UW who lived in the dorms.  Bobs friend was forced to leave campus and go back home; 500 miles away.  
Bob's family and friends all died from the Coronavirus. Fortunately, Bob never got sick beacuse he spent all of his time inside working on his programming projects.
