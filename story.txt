Once upon a time, there was a man named Bob who lived in Madison, Wisconsin.
When he was younger, Bob went to The University of Wisconsin at Madison and his favorite class was CS 400. 

Bob had a friend, who was also in CS400. This friend, however, was not longer able to enjoy the thrills of CS400 because of the Coronavirus. .
